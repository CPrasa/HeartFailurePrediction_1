Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major contributor to global mortality, comprising 
31% of all fatalities. Early detection and management are crucial for heart failure, a 
common consequence of CVDs. This initiative focuses on utilizing machine learning to 
forecast heart failure using an 12-feature dataset.

If we can identify problems of the heart before coming to sudden death, it should help to protect so many lives.
Therefore, it is very important to identify symptoms which canâ€™t feel for the patient until it come like sudden attack.
Because of that, computing those things to find solution to identify heart problems is best way to prevent sudden deaths.
